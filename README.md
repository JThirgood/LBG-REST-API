# Testing

To run tests on this project, use the command.

~~~ bash
npm test
~~~

## Example Test

### Unit

An example unit test we can create for this project is to test the product builder function.

If we test the builder and input a name of "Cascade", a description of "Hops" and a price of 5... We can expet an object to be created that matches this format.

~~~ javascript
{
    name : "Cascade",
    description :"Hops",
    price: 5
}
~~~

### Integration

An example integration test we can create for this project is to test the RESTful endpoints.

If we test the DELETE endpoint by sending a request with a method of 'DELETE' and a path of '/product/delete/1' we should expect th response to be:

Status code: 204
Status text: No content    

### System Testing

Our first example of system testing is 'System Integration Testing' to perform this on our project, we could integration test the CREATE method and check that the output from the READ method is expected.

If we created  Cascade as above and received the 201 status code & text 'Created', we could then read all of the products and expect a status code of 200, status text of OK and a message body containing the Cascade we created.

Alternatively we could BlackBox system test by using the front end to create a new product and reading the page to make sure that the new product has been created

### UAT

Example user story below:

"As a"      USER
"When"      I enter a product id into the update field
"And"       enter new information
"I want"    to be able to see that the product has been updated

GIVEN that a user can access the front-end of the API
WHEN they enter a valid id into the update fiedl
AND they enter a description
AND they enter a price
AND they click on the PUT button
THEN the updated product is visible on the page
